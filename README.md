### Welcome! 👋

Active in Bristol, live in Wiltshire. Work split between FPGA/LAMP/3D - in order of preference. Currently busy with FPGA^2, and starting an OSHW meetup.

If you want to support my work, please consider buying me a Beer etc 🍻

**Standard sections**

In theory, my pages, including my CV, should be available on <a href="https://robinhodson.github.io/RobinHodson/">robinhodson.github.io/RobinHodson/</A>, now.
getting an index page working, took a bit of faffing around though.
