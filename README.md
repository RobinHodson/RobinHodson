Active in Bristol, live in Wiltshire. Work split between FPGA/LAMP/3D - in order of preference. Currently busy with FPGA^2, and attending the OSHW meetup someone-else started with my idea. When I can afford it, I'll start another OSHW meetup, closer to the original principals. Although if Peter hadn't picked up the baton I dropped, we may well have been back in the EU before there was one.

If you want to support my work, please consider buying me a Beer etc 🍻

**Standard sections**

In theory, my pages, including my CV, should be <a href="https://robinhodson.github.io/RobinHodson/">available now</A>.
<br/>Getting an index page working, took a bit of faffing around though.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on finalising my schedule today, getting my github shipshape and ready to accept content. (Severely interrupted by the original machine I was using to do that, dying on me. The replacement is much faster though.)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about the foibles of github, and writing the documentation. I'm restarting/redoing the documentation completely, from a talk I did at php-sw, in March 2024. Now transcribed etc, with shorter talks & updates coming to a venue desperate for speakers near you soon. You can watch me stuttering through <a herf="https://youtu.be/TMfGzMqaWeU">my first talk</a> here.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on getting an in-person OSHW meet-up running. Looks like we *might* have a test on Wednesday 31st May 2024. (We didn't.)
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with getting a Job (ideally logic design, but can do php/javascript/LAMP or 3D stuff).
- 💬 Ask me about anything that seems out, about these pages.
- 📫 How to reach me: <a href="https://about.me/robin.hodson">about.me/robin.hodson</a> covers all the main areas.
- 😄 Pronouns: Oi/you seems to be most popular. Although a close second is, "Sorry, I thought you were a hallucination". 'Not sure how to take that.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm chair of the <a href="http://wiki.worldnakedbikeride.org/index.php?title=Bristol">Bristol World Naked Bike Ride</a>, since 2023.
