<P>This is my pages start file.

<P>Now that works, check out my <A href="cv.html">test file</A>, which tests if interactive SVG/js can be served from here.

<P>If it can, that opens the way for copying and restructuring my  my <A href="http://freedom.is/svg">FPGA^2</A> Project files.

<P>... Although those might live on the FPGA repo, ie the correct one...
  
<HR>
  
<H2>Future FPGA^2 Project Structure</H2>

<P>From all being mangled together, this splits into three sections:
<OL>
<LI>Core FPGA^2 circuits, under simulation.
<LI>The maths behind it.
<LI>Example circuits, not related to FPGA^2.
</OL>

<P>Then again, <B>maybe</B> it would be better/possible to have the main content in the Wiki, and merely link to the
live examples. ... Assuming Wiki pages can't host them.
